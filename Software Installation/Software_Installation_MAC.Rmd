# Introduction
The following instructions will guide you through installing **R**, **RStudio**, and **LaTeX**. Throughout the program you will be asked to turn in assignments in a pdf format. Using R Markdown (.rmd) files in RStudio will allow you to compile files into a pdf. In an R Markdown file you will be able to show written code, outputs from code (including plots), and write like you would in a word processing document. Once you have installed **R**, **RStudio**, and **LaTeX** open the *RStudio_tutorial.rmd* to test if you can knit the file from .rmd to .pdf. 

It is important to download R, before installing RStudio as all versions of RStudio requires users to have downloaded prior to running RStudio. 

Note: Instructions were written for macOS Mojave.

# 3. Download and Install MacTeX
#### Downloading MacTex is necessary for knitr to create a LaTeX file that will then create a pdf. 
* Download MacTeX from this link (it is recommended to download with Safari) :  http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html
  + Click on **MacTeX.pkg** 
    - This package is rather larger (~3.9 Gb) and will approximately 15 minutes (possibly longer) to download. 
    - It is recommended to have your computer charging when downloading large files from the internet. 
    - Do **not** download smaller *BasicTeX* package. You need the entire package for knitr to work properly in RStudio
